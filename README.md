## Project Abstract

Manual question paper preparation is often a time-consuming and challenging task, especially when handling multiple courses and a large number of students. This system provides an automated solution by organizing questions in a categorized database and generating question papers randomly without repetition.

The system consists of separate modules for course management, question entry, question management, question paper generation, and downloading or printing papers. This modular design allows flexibility, scalability, and customization according to institutional requirements while maintaining security and examination integrity.
